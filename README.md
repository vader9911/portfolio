# My Portfolio

## Description

- I created this portfolio page to showcase my future work, and centeralize my presence on the web. 
- The aim of this project is create a project that I can continually develop as my skills as a programer grow.
- I faced many challenges over the course of this project. Some the largest ones I encountered were with formatting. I learned a lot about flex box design and redid my main stylesheet multiple times to reset the formatting and try again.
